## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.
-   A [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for Genkit features.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mishcoders/echonym
    cd echonym
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Firebase and Gemini API keys. You can find your Firebase configuration in your Firebase project settings.

    ```
    # .env.local

    # Firebase Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...:web:...

    # Google Genkit (for AI features)
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Firebase Setup Notes

-   **Authentication**: Enable **Anonymous** sign-in in the Firebase console.
-   **Firestore**: This project uses Firestore for its database. The initial security rules are permissive for development. For a production environment, you **must** configure more restrictive rules.

## ü§ñ Genkit AI Features

AI-powered features like post analysis and tag suggestions are handled by **Genkit**. These features are optional and will only be active if you provide a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file. If the key is missing, the app will run gracefully without AI functionality.

All Genkit flows are defined in the `src/ai/flows/` directory.
